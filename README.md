# news-scraper

When the site is connected to the site several websites will be displayed below the main title card. 

you can have the optian to save articles to a seperate page. On this page you can leave a note on the article you saved or deleat it if you lost interest in it.

there are two more buttons one deleates all of the current articles and another that restores them. 

I need two handlebar links one for the main page and the other for saved news. link the two to gether with links.
