# news-scraper

When the site is connected to the site several websites will be displayed below the main title card. 

you can have the optian to save articles to a seperate page. On this page you can leave a note on the article you saved or deleat it if you lost interest in it.

there are two more buttons one deleates all of the current articles and another that restores them. 

I need two handlebar links one for the main page and the other for saved news. link the two to gether with links.



This site was created using Express, Node.js, Mongodb, Mongoose, Handlebars, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Cheerio by Brian Nickila, following specific instructions by University of Minnesota BootCamp course for Full-Stack Development.

The site allows a user to scrape headlines from New York Times website by clicking the 'scrape' button. The site then renders several articles from the current nytimes.com. It shows the headline, a summary and a link to the full article. It then allows the user to save articles, by switching a saved value from false (default) to true. When the user goes to the saved page, they can see all the articles they've saved. They can then delete them from their saved page if they choose to do so. They can also submit a note to be saved alongside that article.
